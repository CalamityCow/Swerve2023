Team 4079 team is a high school robotics team based at Oxford Academy in Cypress, California. 

## Who are we & What do we do?
We, OA Robotics, build, program, manage, and compete in the First Robotics Competition under the name Quantum Leap. Here at OA Robotics we try to promote the vaules of robotics and STEM, while trying to teach others the concepts of building robots. Our aim is to create a enivorment where all can learn and grow. 

Quantum Leap also hosts and participates in many publicity events such as our district-wide STEAM-A-Palooza, club rushes, and other various events.
## Mission Statement
OA Robotics aims to inspire a new generation of engineers, software developers, and business experts by creating a professional environment. Members work together to both create, program, and publicize their created robots centered around certain tasks. Teams across the world operate under the principle of “gracious professionalism,” where teams maintain a competitive environment but still look to help each other compete and improve their robots.
## Meet our Robots
Over the years we have devopled and built many robots. Here are some pictures of such robots.
